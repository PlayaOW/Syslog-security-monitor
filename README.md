## üìú Description

`syslog.sh` is a Bash script designed to monitor critical system logs and send email alerts to the system administrator. It proactively checks for:

- Unauthorized login attempts
- SSH brute-force login attacks
- Resource contention (CPU, memory, swap usage)

In the event of a security threat or system resource issue, the script can notify the sysadmin via email‚Äîand in extreme cases, it will shut down the system to prevent further damage.
